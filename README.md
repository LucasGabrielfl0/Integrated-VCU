# Integrated-VCU
Integration of the VCU: the car's safety sensors(APPS, BSE, ...), the Eletronic differential and CAN 2.0

## Getting Started!

### Prerequisites

To decrease the complexity of the code and improve it's safety, 2 Header files were created:

CAN 2.0 has methods to get and send data to both Inverters  
```
CAN_2.h 
```

Angle Sensors class has methods to get and validate data from Pedals and angle related sensors (APPS, BSE, Steering Wheel) 
```
Angle_Sensors.h
```
